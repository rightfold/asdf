Account

    An account is an identifier associated with transactions as either a
    debitor or a creditor. Accounts belong to groups, not to users, and do not
    necessarily correspond one-to-one to users.

Group

    A group consists of accounts, a ledger, and users.

User

    A user has credentials with which they log in.
