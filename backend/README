ASDF backend

The ASDF backend is written in Perl and COBOL.

The Perl code is merely for exposing an HTTP API. The actual business rules are
implemented in COBOL.

The COBOL source files are divided into /.cob/ files and /.cbl/ files. /.cob/
files contain programs called from Perl. /.cbl/ files contain programs called
by other COBOL programs.

The COBOL programs exit with a zero exit status when they succeed, and with a
non-zero exit status otherwise. In the latter case, 399 is added to the exit
status to form the status code of the HTTP response.
